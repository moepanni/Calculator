# Calculator Application

#### Video Demo: <(https://bit.ly/4gXSQIv)>

#### Description:
This project is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The application includes functionalities like backspace and clear for user convenience.

The project is structured with a main application file (`project.py`) that contains the calculator logic and GUI components, and a test suite (`test_project.py`) that uses `pytest` to ensure the calculator functions operate correctly. This ensures reliability and ease of maintenance.

### Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive buttons for numbers and operations.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Utility Functions:** Backspace to remove the last input and clear to reset the calculator.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles division by zero and invalid inputs.
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive tests using `pytest` to validate functionality.

### Installation:
1. **Clone the Repository:**

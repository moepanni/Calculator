# Calculator Application

#### [Video Demo](https://bit.ly/4gXSQIv)

#### Description:
This project is a fully functional calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application supports essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, providing users with a smooth and intuitive experience. Additionally, it includes utility functions like backspace to remove the last digit and a clear button to reset the calculator.

#### The project is structured into two main files:

* project.py contains the logic for the calculator and defines the graphical components using Tkinter.
* test_project.py serves as a testing suite using the pytest framework to verify that all functionalities work as expected.

#### Features:

* User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a clean and intuitive interface using Tkinter buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations.
* Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**).
* Utility Functions: Backspace button to delete the last entered character, and clear button to reset the current calculation.
* Error Handling: Provides user-friendly error messages when attempting to divide by zero or when entering invalid inputs (e.g., characters instead of numbers).
* Automated Testing: A set of unit tests is included to ensure the correct operation of all calculator features.
